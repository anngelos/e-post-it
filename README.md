# ePost-It

The project was born out of a need to making small notes and avoid constantly pressing Ctrl + C and Ctrl + V for everything. Just create your post-its with the reminders or information you desire, and they can be easily copied by clicking on the third button on each post-it. You can create, edit, and delete the post-its.
